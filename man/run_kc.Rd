\title{Run Knowledge Convergence Analysis}
\usage{
run_kc(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A cleaned and pre-processed data frame of conversation transcripts.
Must include variables such as `group_num`, `participant_num`, and `text`.}
}
\value{
A named list with the following components:
\describe{
  \item{group_centroid}{A data frame representing the group-level semantic centroid.}
  \item{group_running_centroid}{A data frame tracking the group centroid's cosine similarity trajectory.}
  \item{participant_running_centroids}{A named list of data frames with cosine similarity trajectories for each participant.}
}
}
\description{
This is the primary function of the `knowledgeConvergence` package. It computes semantic similarity measures
between participants and their group by calculating centroids of meaning across time. These results are used to assess
the degree and trajectory of conceptual alignment within a group conversation.
}
\details{
Specifically, this function:
\itemize{
  \item Computes a semantic centroid for each group.
  \item Tracks the running centroid of each group over the course of a conversation.
  \item Computes running centroids for each participant and their evolving similarity to the group centroid.
}

The returned object can be used for further visualization or statistical modeling using other functions in the package.

results <- run_kc(cleaned_data)
